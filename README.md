Assignment Blueprint for backend
===============================

This is a Laravel blueprint for backend development, for creating a multi-tenant application **(single database)** to manage quizzes

## Installation
- clone this repository `git@github.com:mustafa-code/quiz.git`
- cd into the project directory `cd quiz`
- run `cp .env.example .env`
- run `composer install`
- run `php artisan key:generate`
- run migration `php artisan migrate --seed`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`
- serve the application `php artisan serve` or use laravel valet, or any other server
- visit the application in your browser `http://127.0.0.1:8000` 

## Multi-tenancy
This application is multi-tenant, meaning that it can serve multiple clients with a single codebase. To achieve this, we use the [tenancyforlaravel](https://tenancyforlaravel.com/) package. The package is already installed and configured.

## Available models
- Tenant
- User
- Quiz
- Question
- Choice

>Note: you should create missing models, and migrations if needed, or any needed changes to the existing models.

## Your Tasks

  - Fail rate
  - Average score

- Create a REST API for the application, and document it using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
- Write tests for the application using [pest](https://pestphp.com/), already installed.
- write stress testing for the application using [pest](https://pestphp.com/) [bonus point].
- Write a `README.md` file for the application, explaining how to setup and run the application, and how to use the REST API with example for every endpoint.
- Write a `CHANGELOG.md` file for the application, explaining the changes you made to the application, and the new features you added.

### Devops Tasks
- Dockerize the application
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline for the application using GitHub actions
- Deploy the application to a server of your choice [bonus point]

## Points to consider
- Use queues for sending emails, and other heavy tasks you may have [show your knowledge/skills of queues].
- Use queues priority for organizing queues jobs/tasks [bonus point].
- Make sure to use the correct relationships between models, and use the correct database structure.
- Write a clean code, and follow the best practices.
- Write a clean commit messages.

## Notes
- You can use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the frontend, with its free UI kit [tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/).
